		<p>This page is my science essay discussing some issues surrounding AI, including how the use of AI affects the everyday lives of people who are not directly working with it, and did not necessarily grow up in the era when computers were commonplace technology.</p>
		<h2>What is AI?</h2>
		<p>Simply put, AI is the ability of human-made entities to exhibit human-like intelligence. These entities can be entirely digital, but they may take physical forms, such as robotic bodies, or even the thermostat on your wall. In both cases, there is some sort of computer software involved that processes data in order to make decisions, much like what the human brain does.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The development of AI has been supported by the increased computational capacity we have. Even the phone in your pocket (or perhaps in your hand at the moment) is capable of performing millions of computations every second. In addition to the greater computational power of individual computers, the creation of an <em>inter</em>connected <em>net</em>work of computers all around the globe has facilitated transferring and storing massive amounts of data. Just by having an internet-connected device (that you are reading this on), you are using AI without even knowing it.</p>
		<h2>How does AI work?</h2>
		<p>There are many competing approaches to artificial intelligence. One approach is to simulate how the human brain itself works. Another approach is to use logical relationships to represent knowledge. A popular approach that I will go into more detail on is machine learning.</p>
		<h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
		<p>The goal of ML is to produce a model that makes predictions based on data. The training data used to build the model can either be labeled or unlabeled. In the labeled case, known as supervised learning, the true value of what is being predicted is known, and the accuracy of the model can be directly evaluated. In the unlabeled case, known as unsupervised learning, the true value of what is being predicted is unknown, and it is harder to evaluate how well the model performs. In both cases, the model must learn patterns in the data in order to predict an output for a given input.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The models used in ML applications are not always made from scratch. Developers can leverage pre-made models in ML toolkits, fit the model to training data, evaluate the model on testing data, tweak the settings of the model (these are called hyperparameters), then rinse and repeat until the desired evaluation metrics are met.</p>
		<h2>What can AI be used for?</h2>
		<p>The use of AI has proven effective in many areas. The below list highlights some of the more common examples of AI in action, and how it may affect your personal life.</p>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Computer vision:</strong> extracting important features from an image. This is useful for recognizing things like text or faces. You may be using computer vision technology when you take a picture with your phone, as camera applications often come with some sort of face detection feature. The image to the right shows detection of pedestrians. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:D%C3%A9tection_de_personne_-_exemple_3.jpg#/media/File:DÃ©tection_de_personne_-_exemple_3.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/D%C3%A9tection_de_personne_-_exemple_3.jpg" alt="Computer vision example" title="Computer vision" style="float:right" class="exp"></a><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution 2.0">CC BY 2.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11912052">Link</a></li>
			<li><strong>Natural language processing:</strong> extracting important features from text. This is useful for detecting what a message is trying to say. You take advantage of natural language processing technology whenever you check your email, as it is used by email spam filters to protect you from dangerous emails.</li>
			<li><strong>Recommendation systems:</strong> creating recommendations based on the behavior of a user. This is useful for personalizing user experiences. You are probably given personalized recommendations on websites like Netflix or YouTube, which take into account content that you have previously watched in order to recommend new content to watch. In fact, my web application <a href="https://github.com/bobsmith947/recsforme">recsforme</a> uses ML techniques to generate music recommendations.</li>
			<li><strong>Game playing:</strong> teaching a computer how to play a game made for humans. This is useful both for video games (non-playable character AI) and board games like chess or Go. If you have ever played a video game, or a digital version of a board game, you have probably played against (or in some cases with) an AI player. The image to the right shows a robot playing soccer. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:13-06-28-robocup-eindhoven-024.jpg#/media/File:13-06-28-robocup-eindhoven-024.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/13-06-28-robocup-eindhoven-024.jpg/319px-13-06-28-robocup-eindhoven-024.jpg" alt="Game playing and robotics example." title="Game playing and robotics" style="float:right" class="exp"></a><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution 3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26942976">Link</a></li>
			<li><strong>Self-driving vehicles:</strong> teaching a computer how to operate a vehicle. This is useful for making transportation safer. Many vehicles being produced today come with computer assisted or even computer controlled operation, and if you have traveled in a new vehicle, chances are AI helped keep you safe.</li>
			<li><strong>Robotics and automation:</strong> creating robots that are capable of moral reasoning. This is useful for automation, and we do not yet know to what extent, but autonomous moral agents (AMAs) have the potential to radically change society. As AI and robotics technology becomes more advanced, more and more jobs will be able to be automated, freeing human workers to pursue the job they want to have.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>The above use cases only scratch the surface of AI applications, and there is no doubt that AI plays a major role in your life, even without your realization. I hope that this essay has helped you understand more about how AI works, how AI affects your daily life, and how AI uses your personal data. AI is a truly impressive technology that is beneficial to humanity, and AI automation will help make our society more advanced. Although you reading this may not be working on the next big development in AI technology, it is important for us to make sure that AI is developed equitably and ethically.</p>
